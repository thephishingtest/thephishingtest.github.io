        <h3 id="phishing-definition">What is Phishing?</h3>

        <p>Email Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.</p>

        <p>There are many type of phishing, some of these include:</p>
		
		<dl>
            <dt>Spear phishing</dt>
            <dd><p>Attackers may gather personal information about their target to increase their probability of success.</p></dd>
            <dt>Clone phishing</dt>
            <dd><p>Clone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email.</p></dd>
            <dt>Whaling</dt>
            <dd><p>Several phishing attacks have been directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets within businesses, and the term whaling has been coined for these kinds of attacks.</p></dd>
